1. Introduction
👉 "Our API automation framework is designed to ensure the reliability, performance, and security of API endpoints by automating test execution. It is built using Java with RestAssured, Cucumber for BDD, and integrated with tools like TestNG or JUnit for test execution and reporting."

2. Architecture & Tech Stack
📌 Tech Stack:

Java – Main programming language
RestAssured – API testing library
Cucumber – BDD framework for readability
TestNG / JUnit – Test execution & assertions
Maven / Gradle – Dependency management
Extent Reports / Allure – Reporting
Jenkins / GitHub Actions – CI/CD integration
📌 Architecture:

Feature Files (Cucumber BDD) – Define test scenarios in a readable format.
Step Definitions – Implement test logic using RestAssured.
Utility Classes – Handle API requests, responses, and configurations.
Configurations – Store API URLs, authentication, and environment settings.
Reports & Logs – Generate HTML and JSON reports for better test insights.
3. How It Works
1️⃣ Test Execution Trigger – Tests are triggered via Maven/TestNG/JUnit.
2️⃣ Request Construction – Uses RestAssured to send API requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
3️⃣ Response Handling – Validates response status codes, JSON schema, headers, and response times.
4️⃣ Assertions & Logging – Ensures data correctness using assertions.
5️⃣ Reports Generation – Generates detailed execution reports (Allure/Extent Reports).
6️⃣ CI/CD Integration – Automatically runs tests on Jenkins/GitHub Actions.

4. Key Features & Best Practices
✅ Modular Design – Reusable components for better maintainability.
✅ Data-Driven Testing – Supports reading test data from JSON/Excel/CSV.
✅ Environment Configurations – Supports multiple environments (dev, QA, prod).
✅ Parallel Execution – Runs tests in parallel to save execution time.
✅ Logging & Reporting – Uses Log4j & Extent Reports for debugging.

5. Real-World Use Case Example
"For example, in our project, we automated testing for a microservices-based e-commerce platform. We validated login APIs, product search APIs, and payment APIs, ensuring their correctness, response times, and security using our framework. This helped in identifying bugs early and reduced manual testing efforts by 80%."

6. Why This Framework? (Selling Points)
🔥 Scalable & Maintainable – Supports new API tests with minimal changes.
🔥 Faster Feedback Cycle – Quick execution with automated CI/CD.
🔥 Enhanced Test Coverage – Covers functional, regression, and load testing.

7. Conclusion
"Our API automation framework provides a robust, scalable, and efficient way to test APIs, ensuring faster releases with higher quality. It has helped our team improve test coverage, reduce manual effort, and integrate seamlessly into our CI/CD pipeline."
